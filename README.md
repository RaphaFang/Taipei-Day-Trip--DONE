# Taipei-Day-Trip

Taipei Day Trip is a web application designed for travelers exploring Taipei, providing features for attraction booking, itinerary planning, and more. Users can browse various attractions along Taipei's MRT lines, register, add trips to a shopping cart, proceed with credit card payments, and confirm their itinerary upon successful payment.
